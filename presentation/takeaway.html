    <p>My meaningful takeaway is that I have learned to be persistent and to never give up.
    <br> <span style="font-size: 0.75em; font-family: 'Source Code Pro', monospace;">(dispite the errors and multiple times I had to rewrite all of the code.)</span><br>

    <p>One of the biggest challenges I faced was exporting the image, and user experience. I also have a greater respect to all the people that solve these kinds of problems.</p>
    <p>It was suprising to me that what seemed like an simple task like exporting an image was suprisingly hard.</p>
